5) create a git-ignore file which will help us to don't push those file on githibe which we will give the name inside this dile.
6) now, create an Entery file your our Project that whould be server.js or index.js 
7) after that we need to configure the database for that we have to go-to mongoDB altas and create a Project by follow the basic steps--

21) meaning for it app.use(cookieParser());

## ----------- ans -- 
The line `app.use(cookieParser());` in a Node.js and Express application means:

### **What It Does**
- **`cookieParser()`** is middleware that parses the cookies sent with client requests and makes them easily accessible in your application.
- When you use this middleware, it populates a `cookies` object on the `req` (request) object, allowing you to access cookies as key-value pairs.

---

### **Why Use It?**
1. **Simplifies Cookie Handling**:
   - Instead of manually extracting and parsing the `Cookie` header, `cookieParser` does it for you.
   
2. **Access Cookies**:
   - You can easily retrieve cookies from the client request using `req.cookies`.

3. **Signed Cookies**:
   - If you use signed cookies (for added security), it also verifies them using a secret key.

---

### **Example: Without and With `cookieParser`**

#### **Without `cookieParser`:**
You would need to manually parse the `Cookie` header:
```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const rawCookies = req.headers.cookie; // "name=John; sessionID=abc123"
  const cookies = Object.fromEntries(rawCookies.split('; ').map(c => c.split('=')));
  console.log(cookies); // { name: 'John', sessionID: 'abc123' }
});
```

#### **With `cookieParser`:**
You just use `req.cookies`:
```javascript
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
app.use(cookieParser());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.cookies); // { name: 'John', sessionID: 'abc123' }
});
```

---

### **Signed Cookies Example**
If you want signed cookies for additional security:
```javascript
app.use(cookieParser('mySecretKey'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.signedCookies); // Access signed cookies
});
```

In this case, cookies must be signed with the secret (`mySecretKey`) when set, and `cookieParser` will verify their integrity.

---

### **Key Benefits**
- Streamlines cookie parsing and access.
- Works seamlessly with signed cookies for added security.
- Makes it easier to read and manipulate cookies in your app.

Let me know if you'd like an example of setting and reading cookies!

22) include the "start": "index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js" in package.json in script section.
23) to start this backend write the command as : npm run dev

### ----------------- Woking with cart ---------------------
1) create a model for cart: Cart.js
2) create a controller for that cart : cart-controller.js 
3) then after create the controller create the route for it: routers/shop/cart-routes.js
4) after creating the all moduls=> conroller=> route=> then go to app.js or index.js and import cart route
5)
